# Desi Cloud Job Title Generator - Updates

## Recent Enhancements

### 1. Expanded Work Styles and Superpowers

We've significantly expanded the options available in the application:

- **New Work Styles**: Added 8 new work styles including "Frugal Innovator", "Deadline Crusher", "Mentor", "Calm Under Pressure", "Detail-Oriented", "Relationship Builder", "Continuous Learner", and "Minimalist"
- **New Superpowers**: Added 15 new India-specific superpowers including "Finds parking spots in Bangalore", "Can predict when the manager will call", "Can work with stable internet on Indian trains", and more

### 2. Dual Generation System

The application now supports two methods of job title generation:

- **Template-Based Generation**: The original system that uses predefined templates for job titles and descriptions
- **AI-Powered Generation**: Integration with AWS Bedrock for more creative and personalized job titles

Users can toggle between these options using the new checkbox in the form.

### 3. AWS Bedrock Integration

We've implemented a framework for AWS Bedrock integration:

- **Mock Implementation**: Currently includes a mock implementation that simulates AI responses
- **Production-Ready Code**: Structured for easy replacement with actual AWS Bedrock API calls
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Automatically falls back to template-based generation if AWS Bedrock is unavailable

## How to Implement AWS Bedrock

To fully implement AWS Bedrock integration:

1. **Set Up AWS Credentials**: Ensure you have AWS credentials configured with Bedrock access
2. **Install AWS SDK**: `npm install @aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime`
3. **Update API Call**: Replace the mock implementation in `aws-integration.js` with actual AWS SDK calls
4. **Deploy**: Use the provided CloudFormation template or AWS SAM for deployment

See `aws-deployment.js` for detailed implementation instructions.

## Technical Changes

- **New Files**:
  - `aws-deployment.js`: Contains Lambda handler and CloudFormation template
  - `README-UPDATE.md`: This file documenting the changes

- **Modified Files**:
  - `index.html`: Added AI toggle and new work style/superpower options
  - `script.js`: Updated form handling to support dual generation system
  - `styles.css`: Added styling for the AI toggle
  - `aws-integration.js`: Improved mock implementation and error handling

## Next Steps

- Implement actual AWS Bedrock API calls
- Add user feedback mechanism to improve AI responses
- Consider adding a "surprise me" option that randomly selects inputs
- Add analytics to track which job titles and descriptions are most popular
